the idea of binary exponential is follow

when B is even : A^B = A^B/2* A^B/2:
When B is Odd : A^B = A^B/2 *A^B/2 *A;

Modulus algorithm
When B is Odd : A^B%MOD = (A^B/2*A^B/2)%MOD;
When B is Odd : A^B%Mod = (A^B/2 *A^B/2)%MOD * A%MOD:

GCD algorithm
To find Gcd use Euclid algorithm

GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a%b); this is euclid algorithm;
